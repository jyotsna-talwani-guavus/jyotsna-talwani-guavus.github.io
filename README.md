## Why Inner Source

* Code reuse across the organization grows immensely.
* This cross-team collaboration becomes relatively frictionless. 
* Development becomes faster as programmers learn to use unit tests, code coverage, and continuous integration
* Programmers learn to document their code better, both formally (as in-code comments and documentation)
